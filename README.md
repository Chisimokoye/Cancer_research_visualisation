**REPORT ON THE DATA ANALYSED**


This is an analysis of 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

This analysis was done looking into 10 pharmaceutical drugs. 
It has been observed that of 10drugs being analysed, Capomulin and Ramicane showed the lowest variance. This was further confirmed when we computed the quartiles of both drugs.

This could lead us to ultimately assume that there was a lower risk of increasing tumor volumes form the use of both drugs. 


Another observation from the data analysed further buttressed the impact of the negative variance observed. We recognised that there was a negative correlation observed on the analysis of mouse s185 between timepoint and tumor volume.

It was observed that the tumor volume decreased as the timepoint increased. This could lead us to assume that there was an effect on the tumor as time passed after the administration of Capomulin. 


It was also observed that the weight of the mouse had a strong positive correlation with the tumor volume with a n r squared value of 0.71 and a correlation coefficient of 0.84  .
